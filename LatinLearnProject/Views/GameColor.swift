/*
 Light Shade F7F6F6 -> Use this color as the background for your dark-on-light designs, or the text color of an inverted design.
 Light Accent AA8492 -> Accent colors can be used to bring attention to design elements by contrasting with the rest of the palette.
 Main Brand Color A8D2DF -> This color should be eye-catching but not harsh. It can be liberally applied to your layout as its main identity.
 Dark Accent 856C93 -> Another accent color to consider. Not all colors have to be used - sometimes a simple color scheme works best.
 Dark Shades 473D53 -> Use as the text color for dark-on-light designs, or as the background for inverted designs.
